    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Whole wheat coconut oil waffles are healthy fat and healthy grain waffles.
      They freeze well for a quick toaster breakfast! The recipe yield is for
      thin waffles; I'd guess at least half that for Belgian waffles. I like to
      top them with sliced banana.
